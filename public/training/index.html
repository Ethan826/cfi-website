        <p>I am proud to provide the following training and services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery Flights:</strong> A perfect introduction to flying, this first lesson
includes a pre-flight briefing, hands-on flying experience, and post-flight
debriefing. It’s an ideal way to decide if pursuing a pilot’s certificate is
right for you.</li>
<li><strong>Club Checkouts:</strong> I can perform club checkouts for any of the basic
membership airplanes: the Cherokee 180 and Warriors.</li>
<li><strong>Private Pilot:</strong> While earning your “private ticket,” you’ll
cover aerodynamics, navigation, weather, regulations, decision-making, and the
procedures and maneuvers you’ll need to fly alone or with passengers in good
weather. You&rsquo;ll receive ground and flight instruction to prepare you for your
checkride and, more importantly, to be a safe and responsible pilot, able to
make sound decisions and keep learning.</li>
<li><strong>Instrument Rating:</strong> Earning your instrument allows you to fly in a wider
range of weather conditions, enhances your ability to navigate, and lets you
take fuller advantage of the services available to pilots in the National
Airspace System. This rating also increases your responsibilities and exposure
to more complex flying environments. Consequently, we will strongly emphasize
Aeronautical Decision Making and setting personal minimums to ensure safety
and proficiency in instrument meteorological conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Rusty Pilots:</strong> I returned to flying after a significant break, so I
understand the challenges and fears of getting back into the air. I offer
tailored sessions to help you regain confidence and proficiency in the
cockpit. And with experience going back over 25 years, I can help you
understand what’s changed and how it affects you—from the widespread use of
tablets and advanced avionics to updated procedures and phraseology.</li>
<li><strong>CFII (Certified Flight Instructor–Instrument):</strong> This advanced certification
allows you to teach instrument flying, building on your foundational skills to
teach instrument flying to certificated pilots. It particularly emphasizes
developing your ability to instruct students on understanding the <em>why</em>s of
the National Airspace System safe aeronautical decision-making under
instrument flight rules, ensuring they understand the complexities and
responsibilities of flying in varying weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>One service I can&rsquo;t provide is flying you somewhere in the club&rsquo;s airplanes.
That&rsquo;s considered a charter service—a web search for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rdu+charter+flights">RDU charter
flights</a> may be your best
bet.</p>
