      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about &amp;ldquo;empathetic imagination&amp;rdquo; as an important concept in teaching and learning. The Aviation Instructor&amp;rsquo;s Handbook talks about this:&#xA;Lack of common experience between the communicator (instructor) and the receiver (learner) is probably the greatest single barrier to effective communication. Communication can be effective only to the extent that the experiences (physical, mental, and emotional) of the participants are similar.&#xA;In my day job, I work with a programming language called Haskell that has a ton of mathematical and theoretical computer science concepts—much more so than most programming languages.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re considering learning to fly and live in the Triangle, you might wonder what you can do once you have your certificate. Renting a airplane for the whole day or a few days is a significant advantage of flying clubs compared to flight schools, which usually have stricter limits on how long you can take an airplane.&#xA;As a new pilot flying in small planes, you must be flexible and have backup plans if the weather won&amp;rsquo;t cooperate.</description>

      <title>Will an instrument rating make me safer?</title>

      <description>I had a conversation with a friend from my previous job, recently certified as a private pilot. The friend is contemplating an instrument rating. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if we explicitly framed the question, &amp;ldquo;Will an instrument rating make me safer,&amp;rdquo; but that was definitely part of our discussion.&#xA;The obvious answer is, &amp;ldquo;Yes, of course!&amp;rdquo; The disappointing trend continues of non-instrument-rated pilots coming to grief by flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) into Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC).</description>

      <description>Welcome to my website! I’m Ethan Kent, a flight instructor and an honors graduate of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University with over 1,000 hours of instruction given and experience as an Assistant Chief Instructor at a large flight school in San Diego. I’ve trained pilots from the student pilot to flight instructor level.&#xA;I enjoy part-time instructing as a way to share my enthusiasm for aviation with other pilots and aspiring pilots in the Triangle.</description>

      <title>RDU Airport</title>

      <description>Raleigh Flying Club, where I instruct, is located at Raleigh-Durham International Airport.&#xA;Why RDU? Here are some advantages to training at RDU:&#xA;Location: The club’s central location is convenient to Apex, Cary, Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, and other communities in the Triangle.&#xA;Confidence: Learning to fly at a busy, tower-controlled airport like RDU can be a significant confidence booster. While less busy fields offer efficiency, training in a bustling environment equips you with the skills to handle complex airspace.</description>

      <description>I am proud to provide the following training and services:&#xA;Discovery Flights: A perfect introduction to flying, this first lesson includes a pre-flight briefing, hands-on flying experience, and post-flight debriefing. It’s an ideal way to decide if pursuing a pilot’s certificate is right for you. Club Checkouts: I can perform club checkouts for any of the basic membership airplanes: the Cherokee 180 and Warriors. Private Pilot: While earning your “private ticket,” you’ll cover aerodynamics, navigation, weather, regulations, decision-making, and the procedures and maneuvers you’ll need to fly alone or with passengers in good weather.</description>
