      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re considering learning to fly and live in the Triangle, you might wonder what you can do once you have your certificate. Renting a airplane for the whole day or a few days is a significant advantage of flying clubs compared to flight schools, which usually have stricter limits on how long you can take an airplane.&#xA;As a new pilot flying in small planes, you must be flexible and have backup plans if the weather won&amp;rsquo;t cooperate.</description>

      <title>Will an instrument rating make me safer?</title>

      <description>I had a conversation with a friend from my previous job, recently certified as a private pilot. The friend is contemplating an instrument rating. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if we explicitly framed the question, &amp;ldquo;Will an instrument rating make me safer,&amp;rdquo; but that was definitely part of our discussion.&#xA;The obvious answer is, &amp;ldquo;Yes, of course!&amp;rdquo; The disappointing trend continues of non-instrument-rated pilots coming to grief by flying under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) into Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC).</description>

      <description>Welcome to my website! I’m Ethan Kent, a flight instructor and an honors graduate of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University with over 1,000 hours of instruction given and experience as an Assistant Chief Instructor at a large flight school in San Diego. I’ve trained pilots from the student pilot to flight instructor level.&#xA;I enjoy part-time instructing as a way to share my enthusiasm for aviation with other pilots and aspiring pilots in the Triangle.</description>

      <title>RDU Airport</title>

      <description>Raleigh Flying Club, where I instruct, is located at Raleigh-Durham International Airport.&#xA;Why RDU? Here are some advantages to training at RDU:&#xA;Location: The club’s central location is convenient to Apex, Cary, Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, and other communities in the Triangle.&#xA;Confidence: Learning to fly at a busy, tower-controlled airport like RDU can be a significant confidence booster. While less busy fields offer efficiency, training in a bustling environment equips you with the skills to handle complex airspace.</description>

      <description>I am proud to provide the following training and services:&#xA;Discovery Flights: A perfect introduction to flying, this first lesson includes a pre-flight briefing, hands-on flying experience, and post-flight debriefing. It’s an ideal way to decide if pursuing a pilot’s certificate is right for you. Club Checkouts: I can perform club checkouts for any of the basic membership airplanes: the Cherokee 180 and Warriors. Private Pilot: While earning your “private ticket,” you’ll cover aerodynamics, navigation, weather, regulations, decision-making, and the procedures and maneuvers you’ll need to fly alone or with passengers in good weather.</description>
