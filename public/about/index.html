        <p>Welcome to my website! I’m Ethan Kent, a Gold Seal Certified Flight Instructor
(CFI/CFII/MEI). I’m an honors graduate of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
with over 1000 hours of instruction given and experience as an Assistant Chief
Instructor at a large flight school in San Diego. I’ve trained pilots from the
student pilot to flight instructor level.</p>
<p>I enjoy part-time instructing as a way to share my enthusiasm for aviation. My
schedule is a good fit for other full-time professionals looking for
availability outside business hours. I live in Chapel Hill with my wife and
three kids, and I write code in my day job.</p>
<h1 id="flight-instruction-at-raleigh-flying-club">Flight Instruction at Raleigh Flying Club</h1>
<p>I instruct at <a href="https://www.raleighflyingclub.org/">Raleigh Flying Club</a>, located
at Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU).</p>
<h2 id="why-fly-out-of-rdu">Why fly out of RDU?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> The club’s central location is convenient to Cary, Morrisville,
Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence:</strong> Learning to fly at a busy, tower-controlled airport like RDU
can be a significant confidence booster. While less busy fields offer
efficiency, training in a bustling environment equips you with the skills to
handle complex airspaces. This experience prepares you to fly confidently
almost anywhere, whether for fun or as a career and ensures you are
well-practiced in communicating with air traffic control.</li>
<li><strong>Access to Diverse Training Environments:</strong> RDU’s proximity to various
practice areas and smaller airports allows for versatile training sessions.
You can quickly transition from busy airspace to quieter environments to hone
your skills on different maneuvers, offering the best of both worlds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Training at RDU with Raleigh Flying Club provides a comprehensive learning
experience that prepares you for a wide range of flying conditions and
scenarios, setting a solid foundation for your aviation career or hobby.</p>
<h2 id="why-choose-raleigh-flying-club">Why choose Raleigh Flying Club?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Community and Flexibility:</strong> Raleigh Flying Club is not just about flying;
it’s a community of aviation enthusiasts. The club organizes regular social
events, educational gatherings, and fly-outs, creating a vibrant community
that supports each other’s growth and passion for flying.</li>
<li><strong>Variety of Airplanes:</strong> The club offers a diverse fleet, from basic trainers
to more capable airplanes. This variety allows you to train in different
airplane types as your flying skills increase.</li>
<li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Raleigh Flying Club provide savings on the hourly
rate—typically 10–20% on similar airplanes—while offering the flexibility to
rent airplanes for extended periods, which most flight schools do not permit.
This makes flying more accessible and allows for more frequent flying without
the financial burden of sole airplane ownership. The club’s two membership
levels let you begin by flying the standard fleet (Warriors and Cherokees),
and upgrade to the premium membership to access more capable airplane (Bonazas
and the Cherokee 6).</li>

<h1 id="what-i-offer">What I Offer</h1>
<p>At Raleigh Flight Instructor, you’ll find tailored training programs that include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discovery Flights:</strong> A perfect introduction to flying, this first lesson
includes a pre-flight briefing, hands-on flying experience, and post-flight
debriefing. It’s an ideal way to decide if pursuing a pilot’s certificate is
right for you.</li>
<li><strong>Private Pilot Certification:</strong> While earning your “private ticket,” you’ll
cover aerodynamics, navigation, weather, regulations, decision-making, and the
procedures and maneuvers you’ll need to fly alone or with passengers in good
weather. You’ll learn through ground and flight instruction to ensure you’re
ready for your checkride and, more importantly, ready to be a safe and
responsible pilot, able to make responsible decisions and keep learning.</li>
<li><strong>Instrument Rating:</strong> Instrument training allows you to fly in a wider range
of weather conditions, enhances your ability to navigate, and lets you take
fuller advantage of the services available to pilots in the National Airspace
System. This rating also increases your responsibilities and exposure to more
complex flying environments. Consequently, we will strongly emphasize
Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM), setting personal minimums, and
understanding the critical importance of adhering to them to ensure safety and
proficiency in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC).</li>
<li><strong>Commercial Pilot Training:</strong> To prepare you for a professional flying
career, this training sharpens your flying skills to a higher standard of
precision and professionalism. You’ll gain experience in more complex aircraft
and learn about commercial flight regulations.</li>
<li><strong>CFI Initial:</strong> Aspiring flight instructors will develop the skills to train
safe pilots. We’ll cover instructional techniques, lesson planning, and
student evaluation methods. A significant focus of this course is on
instilling a strong safety culture and decision-making skills in students,
ensuring they not only master technical skills but also become prudent,
responsible pilots.</li>
<li><strong>CFII (Certified Flight Instrument Instructor):</strong> This advanced certification
allows you to teach instrument flying, building on your foundational skills to
teach instrument flying to certificated pilots. It particularly emphasizes
developing your ability to instruct students on understanding the <em>why</em>s of
the National Airspace System safe aeronautical decision-making under
instrument flight rules, ensuring they understand the complexities and
responsibilities of flying in varying weather conditions.</li>
<li><strong>Rusty Pilots:</strong> I returned to flying after a significant break, so I
understand the challenges and fears of getting back into the air. I offer
tailored sessions to help you regain confidence and proficiency in the
cockpit. And with experience going back over 25 years, I can help you
understand what’s changed and how it affects you—from the widespread use of
tablets and advanced avionics to updated procedures and phraseology.</li>
</ul>
<p>Training with me at Raleigh Flying Club means you get a structured, yet flexible training program tailored to your individual learning style and goals.</p>
