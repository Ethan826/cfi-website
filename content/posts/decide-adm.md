The first time I heard the
[DECIDE](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/04_phak_ch2.pdf) acronym, I
thought it was a bit silly. I imagined a WWI-era biplane with both wings on
fire, the pilot remarking,

> Oh dear me, we have a problem here, old boy. I _Detect_ that a most
> unfortunate event is in progress, to wit, the burning of the dope on
> my wings spreading rapidly to the fuel tanks. I _Estimate_ that unless
> I can swiftly arrest this woeful situation, I shall very quickly find—

at which point a fireball illuminates the sky. In what universe is a (rather
contrived) acronym useful for helping us make decisions in the air? Can
Aeronautical Decision Making (ADM) really be taught this way?

Similarly, I remember a sense of cynicism regarding
[“antidotes”](https://www.faasafety.gov/gslac/ALC/course_content.aspx?cID=723&sID=1448&preview=true)
to the hazardous attitudes.

> Pilot Bob: I know I’m not current, but I’m going on an instrument
> flight today, and nothing you can say will change my mind!
>
> Pilot Sally: Follow the rules. They are usually right.

> Pilot Bob: Good heavens, I had not considered that. You’re right—my
> scofflaw days are behind me!

Yet at the same time, in the fairly small community of GA flying, we’re seeing
about 1,200 accidents per year, with about 200 of those involving fatalities.
And the causes form a steady drumbeat: VFR into IMC, stalls/loss of control,
controlled flight into terrain, and fuel management, among a few others.

On the “Pilot Debrief” YouTube channel, Trevor Smith, the presenter,
[described](https://youtu.be/3tn0wtRWzJo?si=eE4nbpWl0JLPRTeU&t=485) reading the
transcript of an accident in which the pilot’s son yelled, “Dad, dad!” as the
airplane spiralled towards the ocean in a crash that killed everyone onboard. As
a dad myself, I’m not sure I can imagine anything more terrible than that.

So that’s the gulf we have to bridge in aviation training:

- Get people to take the risks of flying seriously and do everything they
  reasonably can to mitigate those risks.
- Provide teaching and memory aids that don’t make smart-alecks like me roll
  their eyes.
- Avoid sucking all the fun and adventure out of flying, or making it seem too
  scary.

John King (of John and Martha fame) published [“After we had our
accident,”](https://johnandmartha.kingschools.com/2014/05/05/accident-2/) which
covers similar ground.

This is important, according to King, because “if we deny the risks of flying,
we probably won’t do a very good job of managing them.” He goes on to suggest
the [PAVE](https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2022-11/PAVE_0.pdf)
checklist,
[CARE](https://www.faasafety.gov/files/events/SO/SO15/2024/SO15127401/PilotHdbkAeroKnowledge_FAA-H-8083-25B_ch2B.pdf)
situational awareness scan, and
[CHORRD](https://www.flyingmag.com/strike-the-right-chorrd-on-takeoff/)
checklist. I genuinely think the Kings are national treasures and that the
article is great. But I find the ending a bit unsatisfying (which I think the
article itself signals).

I do use the PAVE checklist to help structure briefings. And despite my earlier
snark, the DECIDE acronym is useful in conveying that ADM is an active, ongoing
process.

The airlines now emphasize a model called Threat and Error Management (TEM). In
a nutshell, it posits that Threats (events that happen outside a pilot’s
control, whether anticipated or not) can provoke Errors (mistakes of omission or
commission that the pilot makes), which, if not managed, lead to Undesired
States (which can lead to accidents). TEM is a rich topic, one I haven’t done
justice to here.

Here is my best effort at some conclusions that might help draw together some of
these strands.

- ADM is an active, ongoing process.
- We must pull ADM up to a—nerd alert—_metacognitive level_, meaning a level of
  thinking _about_ thinking. In all of the models, we have to treat our own
  attention and propensity for making errors as its own topic of study and
  attention.
- We ask higher-level questions like,
  - “How am I likely to screw up?”
  - “What can I decide now, while I’m fresh and not under pressure, so I don’t
    even think about it later, when I may be worn out and stressed?”
  - “How can I get ahead of the airplane right now?”
  - “Uh, oh, here’s a problem. I need to work on solving it, but what can I do
    to make sure other important stuff doesn’t fall by the wayside?”
- We practice developing these skills in training. This is a section of every
  task in the Airman Certification Standards (ACS), which defines the standards
  examiner will use on your checkrides. If you’re not covering this material, you
  should challenge your instructor in the same way you would if you didn’t
  practice steep turns or short-field landings.

To this I’ll add one more point. I think you must learn about accidents and
their causes. As I alluded to, it’s grim business. But it will teach you about
the stakes we’re playing with as pilots. And if it feels prurient, it isn’t. At
the risk of sounding a bit woo-woo, we honor the people hurt or killed doing
this activity we all love by taking value from what is otherwise unalloyed
tragedy.

I find YouTube an outstanding source for this material. Some good channels
include—

- [AOPA Air Safety
  Institute](https://www.youtube.com/airsafetyinstitute).
- [Juan Browne (Blancolirio)](https://www.youtube.com/@blancolirio).
- [Trevor Smith (Pilot
  Debrief)](https://www.youtube.com/@pilot-debrief) (just ignore the
  YouTube-algorithm-fueling “Pilot’s SHOCKING mistake” verbiage).
