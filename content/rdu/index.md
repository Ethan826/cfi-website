[Raleigh Flying Club](https://www.raleighflyingclub.org/), where I instruct, is
located at Raleigh-Durham International Airport.

# Why RDU?

Here are some advantages to training at RDU:

- **Location:** The club’s central location is convenient to Apex, Cary,
  Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, and other communities in the Triangle.
- **Confidence:** Learning to fly at a busy, tower-controlled airport
  like RDU can be a significant confidence booster. While less busy
  fields offer efficiency, training in a bustling environment equips
  you with the skills to handle complex airspaces. This experience
  prepares you to fly confidently almost anywhere, whether for fun or
  as a career and ensures you are well-practiced in communicating with
  air traffic control.
- **Access to Diverse Training Environments:** RDU’s proximity to
  various practice areas and smaller airports allows for versatile
  training sessions. You can quickly transition from busy airspace to
  quieter environments to hone your skills on different maneuvers,
  offering the best of both worlds.
