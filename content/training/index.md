I am proud to provide the following training and services:

- **Discovery Flights:** A perfect introduction to flying, this first lesson
  includes a pre-flight briefing, hands-on flying experience, and post-flight
  debriefing. It’s an ideal way to decide if pursuing a pilot’s certificate is
  right for you.
- **Club Checkouts:** I can perform club checkouts for any of the basic
  membership airplanes: the Cherokee 180 and Warriors.
- **Private Pilot:** While earning your “private ticket,” you’ll
  cover aerodynamics, navigation, weather, regulations, decision-making, and the
  procedures and maneuvers you’ll need to fly alone or with passengers in good
  weather. You'll receive ground and flight instruction to prepare you for your
  checkride and, more importantly, to be a safe and responsible pilot, able to
  make sound decisions and keep learning.
- **Instrument Rating:** Earning your instrument rating allows you to fly in a
  wider range of weather conditions, enhances your ability to navigate, and lets
  you take fuller advantage of the services available to pilots in the National
  Airspace System. This rating also increases your responsibilities and exposure
  to more complex flying environments. Consequently, we will strongly emphasize
  Aeronautical Decision Making and setting personal minimums to ensure safety
  and proficiency in instrument meteorological conditions.
- **Rusty Pilots:** I returned to flying after a significant break, so I
  understand the challenges and fears of getting back into the air. I offer
  tailored sessions to help you regain confidence and proficiency in the
  cockpit. And with experience going back over 25 years, I can help you
  understand what’s changed and how it affects you—from the widespread use of
  tablets and advanced avionics to updated procedures and phraseology.
- **CFII (Certified Flight Instructor–Instrument):** This advanced certification
  allows you to teach instrument flying, building on your foundational skills to
  teach instrument flying to certificated pilots. It particularly emphasizes
  developing your ability to instruct students on understanding the *why*s of
  the National Airspace System safe aeronautical decision-making under
  instrument flight rules, ensuring they understand the complexities and
  responsibilities of flying in varying weather conditions.

One service I can't provide is flying you somewhere in the club's airplanes.
That's considered a charter service—a web search for [RDU charter
flights](https://www.google.com/search?q=rdu+charter+flights) may be your best
bet.

<!-- - **Commercial Pilot:** To prepare you for a professional flying
  career, this training sharpens your flying skills to a higher standard of
  precision and professionalism. You’ll gain experience in more complex aircraft
  and learn about commercial flight regulations.
- **CFI Initial:** Aspiring flight instructors will develop the skills to train
  safe pilots. We’ll cover instructional techniques, lesson planning, and
  student evaluation methods. A significant focus of this course is on
  instilling a strong safety culture and decision-making skills in students,
  ensuring they not only master technical skills but also become prudent,
  responsible pilots. -->
