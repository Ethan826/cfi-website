Welcome to my website! I’m Ethan Kent, a flight instructor and an honors
graduate of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University with over 1,000 hours of
instruction given and experience as an Assistant Chief Instructor at a large
flight school in San Diego. I’ve trained pilots from the student pilot to flight
instructor level.

I enjoy part-time instructing as a way to share my enthusiasm for aviation with
other pilots and aspiring pilots in the Triangle. My schedule is a good fit for
other full-time professionals looking for availability outside business hours. I
live in Chapel Hill with my wife and three kids, and I write code in my day job.

I instruct at [Raleigh Flying Club](https://www.raleighflyingclub.org/), located
at Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU). This website is my own and
doesn’t necessarily represent the opinions of the flying club.
