# About Ethan Kent

Welcome to my website! I'm Ethan Kent, a Gold Seal Certified Flight Instructor
(CFI/CFII/MEI). I'm an honors graduate of Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University
with over 1000 hours of instruction given and experience as an Assistant Chief
Instructor at a large flight school in San Diego. I've trained pilots from the
student pilot to flight instructor level.

I enjoy part-time instructing as a way to share my enthusiasm for aviation. My
schedule is a good fit for other full-time professionals looking for
availability outside business hours.

## Flight Instruction at Raleigh Flying Club

I instruct at [Raleigh Flying Club](https://www.raleighflyingclub.org/), located
at Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU).

### Why fly out of RDU?

- **Location:** The club's central location is convenient to Cary, Morrisville, Raleigh,
  Durham, and Chapel Hill.
- **Confidence:** You'll gain the confidence of learning to fly at a busy,
  tower-controlled airport. [Something about acknowledging the efficiency
  advantage of flying out of less busy fields, but speaking busy airports as a
  "first language" gets you ready for confidence flying almost anywhere and
  prepares you to talk to ATC if you're on a career trajectory]
- The airport is a short flight from the practice areas and several smaller
  airports where you can practice [So sort of rebut some of the comparative
  advantages by pointing out we can easily leave RDU and go to TDF or another
  nearby airport and get the best of both worlds while the flipside isn't true,
  i.e. TDF people don't spend much time at RDU.]
