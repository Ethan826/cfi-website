[Raleigh Flying Club](https://www.raleighflyingclub.org/), where I instruct, is
convenient to communities throughout the North Carolina Triangle region. The
club is a great choice for both budding and seasoned pilots. Based at
Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU), the club not only provides an array
of aircraft from basic trainers to advanced models but also fosters a close-knit
community atmosphere where aviation enthusiasts can thrive.

# What Makes Raleigh Flying Club Special?

- **Community and Flexibility:** Raleigh Flying Club is not just about flying;
  it’s a community of aviation enthusiasts. The club organizes regular social
  events, educational gatherings, and fly-outs, creating a vibrant community
  that supports each other’s growth and passion for flying.

- **Variety of Airplanes:** The club offers a diverse fleet, from basic trainers
  to more capable airplanes. This variety allows you to train in different
  airplane types as your flying skills increase.

- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Raleigh Flying Club provide
  [savings](#an-in-the-weeds-note-on-rates) on the hourly rate—typically 10–20%
  on similar airplanes—while offering the flexibility to rent airplanes for
  extended periods, which most flight schools do not permit. This makes flying
  more accessible and allows for more frequent flying without the financial
  burden of sole airplane ownership. The club’s two membership levels let you
  begin by flying the standard fleet (Warriors and Cherokees), and upgrade to
  the premium membership to access more capable airplane (Bonazas and the
  Cherokee 6).

# An in-the-weeds note on rates

It can be a bit tricky to comparison shop. Raleigh Flying Club charges a “dry”
rate for airplanes, meaning the cost for fuel isn’t included.

At the time of writing, the club’s [Cherokee
180](https://brittle.com/raleighflyingclub/piper-cherokee180-9390j/) costs
\$95 / hr dry. Fuel prices at Raleigh fluctuate, but during a recent flight as
of the time of writing, I observed that the cost per hour of fuel at Raleigh in
the Cherokee 180 worked out to about \$65 / hr, yielding about \$160 / hr for
the airplane rental and fuel.

The standard club [dues](https://www.raleighflyingclub.org/fleetandrates/) at
the time of writing are \$125 / month. If you fly 10 hours per month (a
reasonable amount while earning your private pilot’s certificate), you’ll need
to bake in \$12.50 / hr to the rental rate, making the hourly rate about
\$175 / hr all in (but not counting instructor rates, \$70 / hr or \$60 / hr in
bulk).

A similar airplane at a nearby flight school costs \$200 / hr. To rent that
plane solo, you must carry renter’s insurance at about \$500–700 / yr (insurance
is included in the club dues at Raleigh Flying Club). The rate for instructors
at that school is \$65 / hr.

Summarizing, I think it’s fair to say the following:

- The rates at Raleigh Flying Club can save you about 20% on the hourly rate to
  rent the airplane, _including fuel_.
- Taking into account club dues, instructor rates, and renter’s insurance, you
  can probably save about 15% by flying at Raleigh Flying Club, though many
  factors affect that figure.
- The comparison isn’t quite apples-to-apples: being a member of the flying club
  gives you more privileges in terms of using airplanes and membership in a
  community of fellow Triangle pilots.
